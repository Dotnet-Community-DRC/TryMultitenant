# Multitenancy in .NET C#

This project demonstrates how to implement multitenancy in a .NET application, allowing multiple tenants to share the same application instance while maintaining isolation of data.

## Overview

Multitenancy is the architectural pattern where a single instance of an application serves multiple tenants, each with their own isolated data, configuration, and possibly behavior. 
This project provides a foundation for building multitenant applications using .NET.
